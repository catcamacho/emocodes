About and FAQ
-------------

**What is emocodes?**

The emocodes library is a companion to the EmoCodes System (https://emocodes.org).
The EmoCodes System is a standardized and reproducible means of characterizing socio-emotional content in complex video stimuli.
We developed the system for cartoons, but can be used for most video stimuli.

**Why would anyone need a manual coding system when automatic algorithms exist?**

We made the EmoCodes system because there wasn't a way to automatically code emotional content in cartoon stimuli since
the available algorithms were trained on live-action data. As developmental cognitive neuroscience researchers, this turned
out to be an area of real need.

Additionally, we developed the EmoCodes system with open science in mind including a public
data repository (https://emocodes.org/datasets/). We hope researchers will share their data, building a repository of
potential training data for future algorithm development.

**Is EmoCodes a video coding manual or a python library?**

It's both! The EmoCodes System comprises the coding manual (available at (https://emocodes.org/manual/) and the emocodes python library.
The library is used for video processing as well as processing the manual codes for neuroimaging analysis.
Please refer the the examples for use cases.
