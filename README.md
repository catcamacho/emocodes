# The EmoCodes Library

## About
The EmoCodes library was designed to be a companion tool to the [EmoCodes](https://emocodes.org) video coding system.  
This library can be used to do a variety of tasks, however, from video processing to converting Datavyu codes for other 
analyses.

For the code module, the assumption is that the input is a [Datavyu](https://datavyu.org/) style CSV.
